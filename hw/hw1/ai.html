				In her article, <cite><abbr title="https://www.techemergence.com/artificial-intelligence-for-energy-efficiency-and-renewable-energy/">
				Artificial Intelligence for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy â€“ 6 Current Applications</abbr></cite>, on techmergence.com,
				Kumba Sennaar discusses the current application of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> in boosting our use of renewable 
				energy sources. Shennaar found that AI allows 
				us to improve our harvesting power of renewable energy in three ways forecasting, efficiency, and accessibility.  The advanced algorithms 
				that AI can perform will enable companies to predict weather forecasts better. WIth more accurate knowledge of where a gust of winds travel 
				will allow users to better use wind turbines. Sennaar also found companies that have been linking smart sensor to AI to calculate better and
				help monitor their power consumption to more efficiently control the amount of power their company uses. Shennaar also reported that AI had 
				been used to analyze industry data on power grids. Companies have been making use of the data to make better decisions as to where to place
				renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind turbines.
