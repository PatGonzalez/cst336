				<p>
				According to Christopher Helman in his article, 
				<cite><abbr title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2016/06/28/how-much-electricity-does-it-take-to-run-the-internet/#674f575b1fff">Berkeley Lab: It Takes 70 Billion Kilowatt Hours A Year To Run The Internet</abbr></cite>,
				at Forbes.com, the average person uses 200 kWh a year through their internet use which leads to about 300 pounds of carbon dioxide 
				per year in total carbon footprint. Similar to any company or business module, the goal of a tech firm is to get their consumers to 
				spend time using their electronics or apps. Although, the effect that computer scientist and programmers have on the environment can
				have a positive impact. With <b>programmable monostrips</b>, you can monitor and control the amount of power used by all your electronics. 
				The computing power behind <b><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr></b> allows engineers to handle the massive amounts of data that renewable energy 
				resources produce. In a world of concrete and asphalt, the <b>solar roadway</b> can collect a significant amount of renewable energy
				and act as a form data transfer world.
